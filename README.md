# CSS Grids! Woo!

This is a mini challenge to get you a bit more comfortable with grids.

## Directions

1. Let’s start by making this bunch of divs into a grid. Set the `display`
   property of the `div` with class grid to the value necessary to make it a CSS grid.

2. Structure the grid to have four columns: the first two each taking up 25% of the total width. The third column taking up two thirds of the remaining space, and the last column taking up the last third of the remaining space.
3. Give the grid three rows: the first and last 100px each and the middle should be the last third of the remaining space.
4. Make the header take up all four columns of the grid. Place it on row one.
5. The menu belongs in the first column. It needs to span vertically across the second and third rows. Hint: Span towards the end of the third row.
6. Position the main content in the second row, then span across the second and fourth column.
7. The right box is in the right place but needs to be locked down. Place it on the fourth column and second row.
8. Place the footer on the third row and span it across all four columns.
